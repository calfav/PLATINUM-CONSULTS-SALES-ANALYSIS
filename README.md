## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the sales performance of Platinum Consults over the past year. By analyzing various items and aspects of sales data, I seek to identify trends to aid the management in making strategic decisions for the coming year and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

## Data sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "platinum consults.csv" file containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

## Tools

1. Excel: This was the only tool used for this analysis, it was used for

 - Data cleaning
 - Data analysis
 - Data visualization
 - Creating a report

## Data cleaning

I performed the following tasks in the data preparation phase;

1. Data inspection
2. Checking and handling duplicate values
3. Data cleaning and formatting
4. Converting the data to a standard Excel table

## Exploratory data analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as;

1. What is the sales trend report?
2. What is the best-performing product?
3. Who are the top 10 best customers?
4. What are the sales by rep?
5. What are the sales by region?
6. What are the transactions by amount?

## Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows;

 - Platinum Consults had their best sales period in June and December
 - Their best-performing products are beverages
 - Their best customer is company D
 - The salesperson with the highest sales is Miss Nancy Freehafer
 - The region with the highest sales is the North 
 - The highest transactions were between 0$-1000$

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis and results, I recommend the following actions;

 - Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue for example January(new year season), February(Valentine's season), and April (Easter season).
 - Miss. Nancy is the best-performing salesperson of the year, it is recommended she gets promoted to the western region of the company to improve the company's productivity.
 - Ms. Jan has the lowest sales on the list, she needs some more courses on learning about marketing.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis.
